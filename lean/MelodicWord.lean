/- MelodicWord.lean — the first ORDERED melodic-word invariant (directed winding statistic).
   Author: Carles Marín  <karlesmarin@gmail.com>   (with Claude, Anthropic, as assistant)

   All prior bricks (Fourier.lean / Ahat_injective, IntervalVector.lean, …) live on UNORDERED
   pitch-class SETS. This is the first brick on ORDERED melodic WORDS — a `List (ZMod 12)` carrying
   note order (and hence direction).

   Object. A direction-sensitive melodic invariant `W` — the bulk term of the level-2 Lévy-area
   signature `Φ_sig` of a pc-word on the pitch-class circle. `W` is the "directed winding statistic"

       W(xs) = Σ_j f(step_j),   step_j = x_{j+1} − x_j ∈ ℤ/12  (the directed melodic interval),

   where `f` is any ODD function on ℤ/12 with `f 0 = 0`. (Concretely `f(m) = sin(2π m / 12)`; but the
   two laws below need ONLY oddness, and `f 0 = 0` is DERIVED from oddness in a `CharZero` codomain —
   `Hodd` at `m = 0` gives `f 0 = − f 0`.) Isolating exactly what makes the invariant direction-
   sensitive: it is precisely the oddness of `f` summed over the DIRECTED steps.

   Delivered, sorry-free + axiom-clean. The combinatorics live over any `AddCommGroup M`:
   • `steps_reverse`      : `steps xs.reverse = ((steps xs).map (-·)).reverse`   (the reversed word's
                            steps are the negated steps in reversed order — heart of antisymmetry)
   • `W_reverse`          : `Hodd → W f xs.reverse = − W f xs`                    (RETROGRADE ANTISYMMETRY)
   • `W_cons_dup`         : `f 0 = 0 → W f (a :: a :: rest) = W f (a :: rest)`     (repeat the head note)
   • `W_dup_general`      : `f 0 = 0 → W f (pre ++ a :: a :: rest) = W f (pre ++ a :: rest)`
                            (duplicate the note at ANY position — REPETITION / REPARAM INVARIANCE)
   And, in a `CharZero` codomain (e.g. ℝ, the concrete `sin` case):
   • `f_zero`             : `(∀ m, f (-m) = - f m) → f 0 = 0`                      (oddness ⇒ f 0 = 0)
   • `W_reverse_real`, `W_dup_general_odd` : the laws with `f 0 = 0` supplied from oddness alone.

/-! ### Helper: how `steps` interacts with prepending a single LEADING note.

`steps` peels notes off the FRONT. Prepending a note `z` to a NONEMPTY word `(a :: l)` PREPENDS one
new first step `a − z` to `steps`, leaving the rest unchanged. This single fact drives `steps_reverse`
via concat (`reverseRecOn`) induction, since `(xs ++ [z]).reverse = z :: xs.reverse`. -/

/-- Prepending a note `z` before a NONEMPTY word `(a :: l)` prepends the step `a − z`:
    `steps (z :: a :: l) = (a − z) :: steps (a :: l)`. (Just unfolds the recursion.) -/
lemma steps_cons (z a : ZMod 12) (l : List (ZMod 12)) :
    steps (z :: a :: l) = (a - z) :: steps (a :: l) := rfl

/-- **The retrograde step law.** The directed steps of the reversed word are the negated steps of the
    word, in reversed order: `steps xs.reverse = ((steps xs).map (-·)).reverse`. Reversing a melody
    flips every directed interval (`x_{j+1}−x_j ↦ x_j−x_{j+1} = −step_j`) AND their order.

    Proof by concat induction (`reverseRecOn`): appending a trailing note `z` to `xs` is, after
    reversing, prepending `z` to `xs.reverse`. -/

    `W f xs.reverse = − W f xs`, for any ODD `f`. (Each directed step negates under retrograde
    — `steps_reverse` — and `f` odd turns each `f(−s)` into `−f(s)`; the sum then negates.) -/

/-! ### Theorem 2 — Repetition / reparametrization invariance. -/

    of a melodic word leaves `W` unchanged: `W f (pre ++ a :: a :: rest) = W f (pre ++ a :: rest)`.
    The duplicated note inserts a single directed step `a − a = 0`, killed by `f 0 = 0`; all other
    steps are untouched. This is the "tempo / note-value is irrelevant" law — `W` sees the PATH, not

/-! ### Q.2 — ORDER-BLINDNESS of the pc-DFT.  (FORMULAS §Q.2; harvest item 2.)

The DFT coefficient `a_k` of a melodic word is a SUM over the notes of a per-note quantity
`φ(xᵢ)`; the SUMMAND depends on each pitch class alone, never on its neighbours. Hence `a_k`
factors through the MULTISET of pitch classes and is invariant under retrograde (reverse) AND under
any permutation. The crucial point: this needs NOTHING about the exponential — it is pure list-sum
invariance. We give it in two layers.

Layer (a) — ABSTRACT, over any `AddCommMonoid` codomain. The whole content is `List.sum_reverse`
(through `List.map_reverse`) and `List.Perm.sum_eq` (through `List.Perm.map`). -/

two laws (only that the summand is a function of the single note `x`); we use the standard kernel

/-! ### Q.3 — Directional ⊥ a_k : the harmonic axis CANNOT separate a word from its retrograde,
    yet the directed axis `W` CAN.  (FORMULAS §Q.3; harvest item 3.)

`a_k` is retrograde-blind (Q.2), so ANY functional of the WHOLE `a_k`-vector is retrograde-blind too
(`acoef_blind_to_retrograde`): the entire harmonic profile is the same forwards and backwards. The
directed winding statistic `W`, by contrast, FLIPS SIGN under retrograde (`W_reverse`), so it
strictly distinguishes a word from its reverse whenever it is nonzero over a 2-torsion-free codomain
(`W_separates_retrograde`). The two axes are orthogonal-on-direction: harmonic content is symmetric,
directed motion is antisymmetric. -/

/-- **No functional of the a_k-vector separates a word from its retrograde.** For ANY `g` on the full
    coefficient vector `(k ↦ a_k)`, the forward and retrograde words give the SAME value. (The two
    coefficient vectors are equal pointwise by `acoef_reverse`, hence equal as functions.) -/

/-! ### Q.4 — The TRITONE obstruction.  (FORMULAS §Q.4; harvest item 6.)

`f 0 = 0` (the existing `f_zero`) is only the FIRST of the 2-torsion obstructions. ℤ/12 has EXACTLY
two solutions of `m = −m`: the identity `0` and the tritone `6` (`6 + 6 = 12 ≡ 0`). Both are forced
to vanish for any odd `f` over a 2-torsion-free codomain. The tritone `6` is the same central element
`T₆` that recurs throughout the corpus: the unique nonzero element fixed by inversion, the centre of
6-30, the ROP fixed axis (N.1), and the O.1 octave-doubling anomaly. -/

/-- **The TRITONE obstruction.** Any odd `f` over a 2-torsion-free codomain (here ℝ, the concrete
    `sin(2π·/12)` invariant) must VANISH at the tritone: `f 6 = 0`. Since `−6 = 6` in ℤ/12, oddness
    gives `f 6 = f(−6) = −f 6`, and 2-torsion-freeness forces `f 6 = 0` — exactly mirroring `f_zero`
    at the second (and only other) self-inverse point. -/

/-! ### A concrete witness: a genuinely odd `f` on ℤ/12 with `W` direction-sensitive.

`fsign m = (if m.val ≤ 6 then m.val else m.val − 12 : ℤ)` is the signed representative in `[−5,6]`…
but `6 ↦ 6` and `−6 = 6` so that exact map is NOT odd at the tritone. The clean odd integer model
is `g m = m.val − 6·(…)`; rather than fight the tritone we exhibit oddness abstractly: any `f` built
as `f m = h m − h (−m)` is odd, and `sin(2π·/12)` is the analytic instance. We record the small
arithmetic witness that the directed step really does flip sign, which is the whole point. -/

/-- The directed step from `x` to `y` is the negation of the step from `y` to `x`:
    `steps [y, x] = [x − y] = −(steps [x, y])` — the atomic source of retrograde antisymmetry. -/
