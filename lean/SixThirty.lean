/- SixThirty.lean — the order-12 self-duality of set class 6-30 (machine-checked).
   Author: Carles Marín  <karlesmarin@gmail.com>   (with Claude, Anthropic, as assistant)

   The Forte hexachord 6-30 = (013679) (Petrushka / octatonic-subset) is the textbook example of a
   *self-dual* set class: its T/I-orbit has 12 elements, it has no inversional symmetry, its only
   transpositional symmetry is the center {T0, T6}, and the dual group (the centralizer of the
   induced T/I action on the orbit) is again dihedral of order 12 — D₆ ≅ D₁₂/Z. This file proves the
   decidable facts (Tier 1) and the group-theoretic core: the induced action is *regular* and the
   dual has order 12 (Tier 2), with the dihedral fingerprint of the dual (Tier 3).

   Reuses the abstract Wielandt lemma from NeoRiemannian (centralizer of a transitive action is
   semiregular). Fast-loop build via the cross-import recipe (see brick notes). -/

/-! ## TIER 2 — the T/I action on pc-sets, restricted to the orbit, is regular

We make `DihedralGroup 12` act on `Finset (ZMod 12)` by `r i ↦ Tᵢ`, `sr j ↦ I₋ⱼ` (the reindex
`sr j ↦ inv (-j)` is forced to make this a genuine *left* action matching `DihedralGroup`
multiplication). This action restricts to the 12-element orbit `O` of 6-30; the restricted action is
transitive, so by the abstract Wielandt lemma its centralizer in `Sym(O)` is semiregular, bounding
the dual by 12. The 12-element image is itself regular, and an explicit opposite-regular family of
12 commuting permutations witnesses the dual has order exactly 12. -/

orbits). By the abstract Wielandt lemma `NeoRiemannian.Duality.centralizing_fixedPoint_eq_one`, the
centralizer of its image in `Sym(O)` is **semiregular**, so it embeds into `O` and has at most 12
elements. This is the dual group of 6-30. -/

/-! ### The kernel of the T/I action on the orbit is the center `Z = {1, r 6}`

The induced action of `DihedralGroup 12` on `O` is *not* faithful: `T6` (the central transposition,
`r 6`) acts trivially on every orbit element. We show the kernel is exactly `{1, r 6}` — the center
of `D₁₂` for `n = 6` even — so the induced action factors through `D₁₂/Z`, which has order
`24/2 = 12 = |O|` and acts **faithfully + transitively**, i.e. *regularly*. -/

The image `TIgrpO ≅ D₁₂/Ker` has order `24/2 = 12 = |O|`, and acts transitively on `O`. A
transitive action of a group whose order equals the size of the set is **regular** (simply
transitive). This is the precise sense in which the T/I action on the 6-30 orbit is the *regular
representation of `D₁₂/Z ≅ D₆`*. -/

/-! ### The lower bound `|C| ≥ 12` — the opposite regular representation

For each `B ∈ O`, transitivity gives some `h` with `h • base = B`; the choice of `h` is unique only
mod `Ker`, but since `Ker` fixes every orbit point, `B ↦ h • (g • base)` is *well-defined*. This is
the **opposite regular representation** `opp g`: it commutes with the whole left T/I action (so lies
in `Cgrp`), and `opp g base = g • base`, so `g ↦ opp g` separates the 12 cosets of `Ker`. Hence the
dual has at least 12 elements, and with the Wielandt bound, exactly 12 — it acts regularly. -/

/-! ## TIER 3 — the dihedral fingerprint of the dual

The opposite representation `opp` is a group **anti-homomorphism** `D₁₂ → Sym(O)` with image `Cgrp`
and kernel `Ker = Z`, so `Cgrp ≅ (D₁₂/Z)ᵒᵖ ≅ D₁₂/Z`. Mathlib has no `D₁₂/Z ≃* D₆`, so we land the
*dihedral fingerprint* that pins `Cgrp ≅ D₆` among the five groups of order 12: `Cgrp` is

* order 12 (Tier 2),
* **non-abelian**, with
* an element `s` of **order 6** and
* an **involution** `t ≠ 1` that **inverts** it: `t * s * t = s⁻¹` and `s * t ≠ t * s`.

These four facts identify `Cgrp ≅ DihedralGroup 6`; the named `≃*` is the remaining (Mathlib-gap)
step `D₁₂/Z ≃* D₆`. -/

/-! ### Tier-3 summary — the dihedral fingerprint of the dual

Bundled: `Cgrp` has order 12, is non-abelian, contains an element `s` of order 6 and a non-trivial
involution `t` that inverts it (`t s t = s⁻¹`). These pin `Cgrp ≅ DihedralGroup 6` among the order-12
groups. The named `Cgrp ≃* DihedralGroup 6` requires `D₁₂/Z ≃* D₆`, absent from Mathlib. -/
